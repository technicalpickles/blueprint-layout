h1. BlueprintLayout

Not for the faint of heart, this plugin is used to build HTML structures with the appropriate Blueprint classes for a grid-based layout.

h2. Notice: Only Works with Rails 2.2.2+!

This is because the way views have been handled in previous versions are wonky, and I don't want to write a bunch of conditionals to handle older versions of Rails (yet).

Ambitious?  Fork this puppy and patch it.  I'll point you to the right direction even: within @lib/view_helpers.rb@, the problem area is introduced after the constant @BLOCK_CALLED_FROM_ERB@.  Good luck!

h2. Examples

You're going to want to wrap your content in a @container@ block.

From there, use symbols (underscored, as fractions) or numbers to define the width of your columns.  I prefer the fractions.

    <% container do %>
      <% column :three_fourths do %>
        <!-- this will be a div.span-18 -->
        <% column :half do %>
          <!-- this will be a div.span-9 -->
        <% end %>
        <% column :one_third, prepend_one_sixth, :last do %>
          <!-- this will be a div.span-6.prepend-3.last -->
          <% column :half do %>
            <!-- this will be a div.span-3 -->
          <% end %>
          <% column :half, :last do %>
            <!-- this will be a div.span-3.last -->
          <% end %>
        <% end %>
      <% end %>
      <% column :one_fourth, :last do %>
        <!-- this will be a div.span-6 -->
        <% column 5 do %>
          <!-- this will be a div.span-6 -->
        <% end %>
        <% column 1, :last do %>
          <!-- this will be a div.span-1.last -->
        <% end %>
      <% end %>
    <% end %>
